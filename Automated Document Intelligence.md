# üìÑ Pattern: Automated Document Intelligence

## Intent

To extract, classify, validate, and summarize unstructured or semi-structured documents using AI‚Äîreducing manual processing time, improving accuracy, enabling downstream automation, and enhancing compliance traceability.

---

## Context

Organizations receive large volumes of documents‚ÄîPDFs, scans, forms, images, contracts, invoices, applications‚Äîthat contain essential operational data. These are heterogeneous in layout and content, and often require human interpretation, leading to delays, inconsistency, and bottlenecks in workflows such as onboarding, eligibility review, contract processing, and regulatory submission.

Automated document intelligence uses a combination of OCR, NLP, layout analysis, and ML classification to convert document streams into structured, machine-readable formats.

---

## Problem

How can diverse, unstructured document inputs be automatically and accurately transformed into actionable structured data‚Äîat scale, with explainability, and under variable formats and layouts?

---

## Forces

| **Force**                      | **Tension**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Layout variability             | Reduces accuracy on unseen formats or poor scans                             |
| Structured vs Semantic parsing | Structured forms need different logic than unstructured narratives           |
| Document diversity             | Requires routing to appropriate extraction pipelines                         |
| Confidence vs Automation       | Low-confidence fields must be flagged for human validation                   |
| Language/format diversity      | Needs flexible architecture for multilingual, scanned, and handwritten docs  |

---

## Solution

A document intelligence pipeline combining OCR, layout-aware transformers, classification models, and field-level extractors to:

- Classify document types (e.g., ID, paystub, invoice, contract)  
- Extract named entities and structured/tabular fields  
- Handle scanned or camera-captured documents with preprocessing  
- Apply confidence scoring with human-in-the-loop fallback  
- Log traceable decisions for audit/compliance  
- Output structured formats (JSON, XML, DB rows) for downstream use

## Implementation Considerations

### üß† OCR & Preprocessing

- Use open-source or cloud OCR (e.g., Tesseract, PaddleOCR, Textract, Azure Form Recognizer)
- Apply image cleanup: rotation correction, binarization, noise filtering
- Normalize input formats before inference

### üóÇÔ∏è Classification & Extraction Models

- Layout-aware: `LayoutLMv3`, `Donut`, `DocFormer`
- Form-specific: hybrid of `Doc2Vec` + rules + XGBoost
- NER for fields like `name`, `DOB`, `address`, `amount`, `signature date`
- Table extraction using `Camelot`, `pdfplumber`, or transformer-based extractors

### üîé Confidence & Explainability

- Log field-level confidence scores
- Use token highlighting or bounding boxes to show contributing regions
- Threshold-based human intervention or flagging

### üîê Security & Privacy

- Redact or mask PII during review and export
- Encrypt documents and outputs at rest and in transit
- Log reviewer access and edit actions

### üì§ Output Integration

- Export to JSON, XML, or SQL tables
- Integrate with APIs, RPA bots, or workflow systems
- Generate summaries for high-level review or routing

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Using a one-size-fits-all model across document types  
- Ignoring field confidence thresholds for critical workflows  
- Treating OCR output as final without post-correction logic  
- Failing to validate extractions against known templates or schemas  
- Storing PII in raw form without masking, encryption, or access controls
