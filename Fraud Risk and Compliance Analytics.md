# 🕵️‍♂️ Pattern: Fraud, Risk & Compliance Analytics

## 🧭 Intent
To empower organizations with the ability to proactively detect, contextualize, and act on fraud, compliance drift, and operational anomalies—through the fusion of statistical learning, symbolic reasoning, graph-based behavior modeling, and real-time inference—while meeting regulatory, ethical, and governance constraints.

---

## 🌍 Context
In regulated environments—finance, biotech, public services, telecom—fraud and non-compliance are not isolated incidents but emergent behaviors. Rules alone can’t keep up with adversaries. Traditional audit systems are retrospective, brittle, and biased toward known patterns. Meanwhile, data is multi-modal, high-velocity, and often siloed. Regulatory regimes demand explainability, yet attackers adapt in real time.

---

## ❓ Problem
How can we detect **novel**, **evasive**, or **coordinated** risk behaviors in fragmented enterprise systems, under real-world latency, without labeled training data—while producing outputs robust enough for regulated action, investigation, and systemic response?

## ⚖️ Forces

| Force                       | Tension                                                               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Detection Precision vs Coverage | Tight models miss new fraud; loose models overwhelm investigators |
| Explainability vs Accuracy | GNNs and ensembles outperform simple models but resist interpretation |
| Velocity vs Governance     | Real-time needs clash with auditable traceability and reproducibility |
| Adversarial Adaptation     | Attackers evolve faster than model refresh cycles                     |
| Privacy vs Observability   | Behavioral visibility must comply with consent, redaction, and masking|

## 💡 Solution

A layered architectural approach combining:

- **Data Harmonization**: across systems (ERP, CRM, EMR, payments, logs)
- **Temporal + Relational Feature Extraction**: frequency, burst, proximity, trail entropy
- **Model Ensemble**:
  - Isolation Forests / LOF (unsupervised anomaly detection)
  - Gradient-boosted classifiers (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost)
  - Graph-based models (e.g., GNNs, collusion detection, social path anomalies)
- **Risk Engine**:
  - Threshold calibration and risk scoring
  - Domain rules mapped to regulatory anchors
- **Explainability Pipeline**:
  - SHAP, Anchors, counterfactuals, summary narratives
- **Investigation Workflow**:
  - Case routing, override logging, escalation, feedback loop
