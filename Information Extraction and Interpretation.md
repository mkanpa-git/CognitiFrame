# üìÑ Pattern: Information Extraction & Interpretation

## Intent
To **transform unstructured or semi-structured raw data**‚Äîincluding text, genomics, audio, or social signals‚Äîinto **structured, interpretable insights** that can power analysis, decision-making, and service interventions.

The goal is to **make raw signals meaningful**, while preserving accuracy, traceability, and context fidelity.

## Context
Institutions increasingly collect **vast volumes of raw data** from:

- Clinical genomics (sequencing)
- Public health reports
- Social media signals
- Citizen communications
- Sensor feeds

However, raw data alone is **incoherent and unanalyzable** at operational scale.  
Extraction and interpretation systems **parse, classify, align, and transform signals** into structured, policy-relevant knowledge artifacts‚Äîempowering analysis, prediction, and intervention.

Errors in extraction or misinterpretation risk **false insights**, policy missteps, or loss of public trust.

## Problem
How can institutions **accurately and systematically extract actionable knowledge** from noisy, voluminous raw data‚Äîensuring outputs are reliable, interpretable, and fit-for-purpose?

## Forces

| Force | Tension |
|:------|:--------|
| Signal Noise vs Insight | Raw data may be sparse, ambiguous, or noisy |
| Fidelity vs Abstraction | Over-simplifying signals risks losing critical nuances |
| Interpretation Bias | Model or human assumptions can distort extracted meaning |
| Evolution of Input Domains | Languages, genomics, and social signals evolve over time |
| Scale and Throughput | Extraction must keep pace with incoming data volume |

## Solution
An information extraction and interpretation system that:

- Ingests diverse raw data types (text, genomics, audio, event streams)
- Applies parsing, alignment, classification, and annotation models
- Transforms raw inputs into structured, machine-usable artifacts (e.g., entity lists, phylogenetic trees, outbreak signals)
- Captures provenance and uncertainty metadata alongside outputs
- Enables human validation loops and feedback incorporation
- Monitors extraction drift, domain shifts, and interpretation errors over time

## Participants

| Component | Responsibility |
|:----------|:---------------|
| Data Ingestion Layer | Collects and normalizes raw input streams |
| Feature Extraction & Parsing Engine | Identifies meaningful units (entities, mutations, anomalies) |
| Structured Artifact Generator | Produces formatted, interpretable outputs (e.g., JSON, trees, maps) |
| Context Manager | Tracks origin, confidence scores, extraction methods |
| Human Validation & Drift Monitor | Oversees quality assurance, flags domain shifts or extraction decay |

## Consequences

| Benefit | Trade-off / Mitigation |
|:--------|:-----------------------|
| Unlocks vast unstructured data sources for actionable use | Extraction errors can propagate misleading interpretations |
| Speeds up insight generation from complex signals | Must balance automation with human review for critical domains |
| Enables structured analytics, machine learning, and dashboards | Requires investment in continuous quality monitoring and retraining |
| Bridges operational systems with real-world complexity | Interpretability must be preserved; black-box extraction is dangerous |

## Known Applications

| Agency/Institution | Use Case |
|:-------------------|:---------|
| DOHMH | Genomic alignment and outbreak detection (Minimap2, BWA, Guppy, IQTREE, kSNP3) |
| DOHMH | Social media surveillance for disease outbreak signals |
| DOE | Text analytics for incident reporting in schools |

## Implementation Considerations

### üß† Model Design and Extraction Logic
- Choose domain-appropriate extraction models:
  - NLP for text
  - Alignment for genomics
  - Signal processing for audio streams
- Include confidence scoring and traceability in outputs
- Architect modular pipelines for evolving data types and domains

### ‚öñÔ∏è Accuracy, Interpretability & Ethics
- Validate extraction models with domain experts before operational use
- Surface uncertainty explicitly‚Äîdo not present inferred signals as deterministic
- Respect cultural and social nuances in text and signal interpretation

### üîÅ Continuous Adaptation & Drift Monitoring
- Implement drift detectors (e.g., domain shift in language, social sentiment, new genomic variants)
- Retrain or recalibrate models proactively, not reactively

### üîê Data Privacy and Sensitivity
- Anonymize personally identifiable data during extraction when possible
- Respect ethical boundaries when analyzing citizen communications
