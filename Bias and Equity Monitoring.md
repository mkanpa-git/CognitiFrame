# ⚖️ Pattern: Bias & Equity Monitoring

## Intent

To identify, measure, and mitigate systemic or algorithmic bias within decisions, services, models, or resource allocations—enabling equitable treatment, transparency, and compliance with ethical, legal, or organizational fairness mandates.

---

## Context

In both human- and machine-mediated decision systems, bias may arise from historical inequities, flawed data, or opaque logic. In domains like loan approvals (finance), clinical trial inclusion (biotech), hiring pipelines (HR tech), or benefit distribution (public sector), disparities in outcomes across protected attributes (e.g., gender, race, disability status) may reflect unintentional discrimination or structural disadvantage.

Fairness is not only a legal or reputational imperative—it is a model governance requirement in AI/ML systems and a strategic trust vector for public and employee engagement.

---

## Problem

How can organizations detect when a system—human or automated—disproportionately impacts individuals or groups based on protected attributes, and intervene before harm occurs?

## Forces

| **Force**                      | **Tension**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Group fairness vs Individual accuracy | Correcting aggregate disparities can introduce individual unfairness     |
| Fairness definitions conflict | Equal opportunity ≠ demographic parity ≠ equalized odds                     |
| Protected attributes may be missing | Sensitive attributes like race, gender, or disability may not be collected |
| Intervention must be explainable | Stakeholders must understand and trust fairness actions                   |
| Legal defensibility           | Patterns must be supported by interpretable metrics and documented processes |

---

## Solution

A structured fairness monitoring architecture that combines data audits, model bias quantification, outcome disparity detection, and corrective overlays. The system should allow tracking bias over time, simulating fairness interventions, and integrating mitigation into retraining or operational policy.

### It includes:

- Group-level and individual-level fairness diagnostics  
- Algorithmic and policy-level disparity audits  
- Bias dashboards and compliance reports  
- Bias mitigation options (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing)  
- Simulations to assess policy change impact on equity

## Implementation Considerations

### Fairness Metrics to Monitor

- Statistical Parity Difference  
- Equal Opportunity Difference  
- Average Odds Difference  
- Demographic Parity Ratio  
- Counterfactual Fairness Score  

### Protected Attributes

- **Explicit**: race, gender, age, disability  
- **Proxy-detected**: ZIP code, name, device, behavior clusters  

### Mitigation Techniques

- **Pre-processing**: Reweighing, re-sampling, suppression  
- **In-processing**: Adversarial debiasing, fairness constraints  
- **Post-processing**: Calibration, threshold adjustment, rejection option  

### Explainability

- SHAP, LIME with cohort overlays  
- Bias heatmaps by demographic segment or region  

### Governance Integration

- Align with internal review boards, compliance units, and standards (EEOC, GDPR, FDA, etc.)

- Using only accuracy as a performance metric (omits subgroup harm)  
- Masking protected attributes without addressing proxy bias  
- One-time fairness audits without longitudinal monitoring
