# üß≠ Pattern Name: Decision Traceability & Institutional Memory

## 1. Intent

To ensure that every AI-augmented or human-executed civic decision‚Äîespecially those with regulatory, ethical, or public consequence‚Äîis traceable, reproducible, and explainable across time. This pattern creates structured institutional memory by capturing not only *what* decision was made, but *how*, *by whom*, and *under what rationale, data context, and policy conditions*.

---

## 2. Context

In complex civic systems, decisions emerge from a blend of machine predictions, human discretion, business rules, legal mandates, and evolving policies. Without traceability, governments risk:

- Inability to explain or justify past decisions
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Loss of institutional knowledge due to staff turnover
- Disjointed service experience across agencies and time

This pattern serves accountability, learning, legal defensibility, and systemic trust by encoding **decision provenance** into a durable, queryable, and contextual structure.

---

## 3. Problem

How can governments create durable memory of how decisions were made‚Äîspanning algorithmic logic, human reasoning, data context, and policy justifications‚Äîin ways that support transparency, auditing, appealability, and future model refinement?

## 4. Forces

| **Force**                  | **Tension**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Speed vs Memory Fidelity   | Real-time decision systems may lack mechanisms to store rich decision logic |
| Human discretion vs systematization | Caseworkers use nuanced judgment, which is hard to encode or reproduce        |
| Model drift vs justification stability | Predictions evolve over time, but their past justifications must remain consistent |
| Explainability vs reproducibility | Decisions may be explainable at runtime, but not traceable after the fact       |
| Legal auditability vs personal privacy | Decision records must be reviewable without overexposing sensitive data        |

---

## 5. Solution

A **decision provenance and replay architecture** that captures:

- Model predictions and feature contributions
- Human inputs and overrides
- Applicable rules, thresholds, and justifications
- Versioned artifacts (model, policy, data schema)
- Reasoning logs and scenario context

The architecture supports:

- Decision audit trails
- Counterfactual replays
- Organizational learning
- Public trust and legal review

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Model/Logic Versioning:
- Use `MLflow`, `DVC`, or `Model Cards` to track model metadata  
- Store policy rules in `Git`, `decision tables`, or `rule engines` (e.g., Drools, DecisionFirst)

### Structured Trace Format:
- Use canonical trace schemas (JSON-LD, OpenTrace, or domain-specific ontologies)  
- Embed SHAP explanations, override reasons, time stamps, and user annotations

### Ledger/Store:
- Immutable storage using audit-grade systems (e.g., event-sourced DB, blockchain-inspired)  
- Indexed on case ID, date, rule/model ID, and actor ID

### UI Integration:
- Visual replay of "what the system saw and decided"  
- Allow staff to input rationale, escalate, or override decisions

### Governance Hooks:
- Define roles for reviewers (e.g., ethics board, internal audit, appeals board)  
- Integrate feedback loops into model retraining or policy refinement

## 12. Anti-patterns to Avoid

- ‚ùå Logging only final decisions without input features, model version, or user notes  
- ‚ùå Allowing overrides with no reason codes or audit trail  
- ‚ùå Building black-box ensembles with no feature attribution  
- ‚ùå Retaining decision traces in siloed, unsearchable logs  
- ‚ùå Designing for traceability only after launch (should be embedded from start)
